## Projects

### Fraud Detection Using Data Mining Techniques
- Designed a fraud detection system to analyze over 6 million financial transactions, identifying anomalies and reducing false positives.  
- Used advanced data preparation methods, such as ADASYN and SMOTE, to rectify the imbalance in classes.  
- SMOTE with XGBoost and LightGBM improved the recall for fraudulent transactions from 0.16 to 1.00 by simulating real-world scenarios utilizing models like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression with time-based splitting.  
- The data was presented to enhance accuracy and efficiency using ROC AUC ratings and confusion matrices.  
- Currently, a study article based on the methods and findings is being prepared.
